This notebook explaines how I went into the analysis of the Titanic code, first cleaning the datasets
of test and training, and doing some one hot encding, and replacing the missing values when needed
I also use the LazyClassifier that make use of many machine learning models at the same time 
for time gaining and better comaparison, the RidgeClassifierCV gave the best results, and I concluded my predictions with it.
